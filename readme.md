# Kids Book Swap 

The Kids book Swap club in Stockholm is a book club that aims to improve the accessibility of children’s books in different languages by creating a forum for expat parents and kids to swap their books.  We want to make reading more attractive and improve the accesibility. With this website we want to attract more people with clear information and a simple sign up form. In this way we can grow our target audience, provide more books and get more children reading.

### Design 

For the design the choice is made for a combination of modern and traditional elements. Books are seen as something old, be we want to reimaging them as something that is also fitting in a modern context, something that is hip, cool and fun while maintaining the more traditional library feel. In this way we hope to not only convince the parents but also the children. 

1. Images

The hero image was selected first. This was chosen because it is a visual representation of what we wanted to achieve as an organisation. 
It supports this idea of reading as supporting creativity, imagination and inspiration. 

The image in the about section was chosen to visually represent our target group and present reading as a fun activity for our kids. 

The background to the event section was chosen to give a more old-school calendar feeling. We try in our website to combine more traditional and modern aspects.  

2. Colour Scheme

The colour scheme was chosen based on the hero picture. 
We choose a darker background and lighter text for creating a cosy, hip and library fitting vibe.

3. Typography

For the logo and the text on the hero picture was the font Fjalla One this font has an elegant design. 
The rest of the text is written in the Merriweather font which was chosen because of its great readability. 
The fonts are both more traditional design with some modern accents which aligns with the feel of the organization and the website.

## Features
### Navigation Bar
The website is a single page website. So the navigation bar is an essential part of the website. It allows you to move throughout the different parts of the website without excessive scrolling. The navigation bar is also responsive. When the viewport gets smaller the text converts into symbols that allow for a better layout. 

On the navigation bar is also the logo. When clicked on it go automatically back to the top of the website.

### Hero image and text
The Hero image tries to create a mystical and creative mood. We want to show the image of how books spark our imagination. 

On the hero image you also find "kids book swap club Stockholm" so you know what we do and we are located in Stockholm. 
Under this you also get the text "find books in your mother tongue" so you know it is meant for a expat public.
