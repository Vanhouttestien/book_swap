### Kids Book Swap 

The Kids book Swap club in Stockholm is a book club that tries to improve the accesibility of children books in different language's by creating a forum for expat parents and kids to swap their books. With this website we try to better our accesibility so we can attract more people with clear information and a simple sign up form. In this way we can grow and provide more books and towards the future more languages.

You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Existing Features
#### Navigation Bar
The website is a single page website. So the navigation bar is a essential part of the webiste. It allows you to move troughout the different parts of the website within excessive scrolling. The navigation bar is also responsive. When the viewport get's smaller the text converts in to symbols that allow for a better layout. 

On the navigation bar is also the logo. When clicked on it go automaticlaly back to the top of the website.

### Features Left to Implement

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Validator Testing 

#### HTML
#### CSS
### Unfixed bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment 

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
